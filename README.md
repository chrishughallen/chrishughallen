### Hi there 👋

I'm Chris, an American web developer based in Paris.

I'm the front end developer at [Bergamotte](https://www.bergamotte.com) and I spend most of my time working with Javascript, scss, and Ruby.

I am currently learning React outside of my day job, and you can see a couple of my recent projects here.

[Todo List ](https://react-todo-list-iota.vercel.app/) - Original, I know.

[Tenszies](https://react-tenzies.vercel.app/) - Try your luck at this fun dice game!  

You can also take a look at my personal site [here](https://chrishughallen.github.io/app/index.html), though it is still in progress (forever).

Outside of coding I like to Travel, make music (check out my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/mr-cadwalter)), and cook/eat good food.
