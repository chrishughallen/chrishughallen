### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris, an American web developer based in Paris.

I'm the front end developer at [Bergamotte](https://www.bergamotte.com) and I spend most of my time working with Javascript, scss, and Ruby.

I am currently learning React outside of my day job.

My Current React Project

[lorem-blog-posts](https://react-blog-posts.vercel.app/) - A basic fetch application that using the JSONplaceholder API. Using localStorage you can favorite/unfavorite blog posts, as well as follow/unfollow users. I am currently working on implementing all the back end features before any major styling, so don't expect anything beautiful, but it's functional!

Finished React Projects

You can also take a look at my personal site [here](https://chrishughallen.github.io/app/index.html), though it is still in progress (forever).

Outside of coding I like to Travel, make music (check out my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/mr-cadwalter)), and cook/eat good food.
